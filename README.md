Introduction
Hate speech and offensive content on social media and online platforms have become major concerns. This project aims to create a deep learning model capable of identifying hate speech using an LSTM-based neural network.

By analyzing textual data, the model can classify inputs into predefined categories (e.g., hate speech, offensive language, or neutral).

Features
Preprocessing text data (tokenization, padding, and cleaning).
Word embeddings for feature extraction.
LSTM layers to capture contextual information.
Classification of text into three categories:
Hate Speech
Offensive Language
Neutral
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
